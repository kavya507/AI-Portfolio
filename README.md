## Projects

**Project 1: Netflix Data Analysis, Tableau Public**
- Leveraged Tableau for in-depth analysis of Netflix data, extracting insights on viewership trends and genre preferences.
- Enhanced user experience with dynamic tooltips and parameter controls, translating complex data into visually appealing charts for informed decision-making.

**Drug Activity Prediction | Python, SMOTE, PCA, AdaBoost**
- Treated the imbalanced data using SMOTE and applied Dimensionality reduction technique (PCA) to compress data.
- Developed an ensemble classification model using AdaBoost to prognosticate the likelihood of the Drug, given its topological shapes and features, and achieved an accuracy of 79% by tuning the hyperparameters using a cross-validation technique.

**Digit Recognizer | tSNE, K-Means**
- Handled MNIST dataset with images of hand-drawn digits by normalizing and reducing dimensions of data using tSNE.
- Implemented K-Means using Euclidean distance to cluster the similar instances and acquired an accuracy of 76% with 24 runs and to tune the hyper parameter ‘k’ value, used Silhouette Score evaluation metric.
